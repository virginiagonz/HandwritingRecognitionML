# HandwritingRecognitionML
The dataset includes 1797 small images (8x8 pixels), each one includes a hand-written digit (0-9). You have to download the corresponding csv file that includes the labels of the images. The goal is to build a Machine Learning Algorithm that can recognize the hand-written digits!
